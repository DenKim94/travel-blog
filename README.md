## Project Description

The web application is designed to create and manage travel blogs. It leverages Strapi as a headless CMS for flexible and efficient backend content management. The frontend is built using Next.js with React and TypeScript.

This project also serves as a learning opportunity to deepen and expand my knowledge in Next.js, React, and TypeScript through practical development and real-world application.
